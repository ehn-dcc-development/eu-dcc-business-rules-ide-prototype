= Design

The Business Rules IDE is used to implement a specification for business rules for the EU DCC.
A specification consists of:

* a rule set,
* tests that exercise individual rules of the set, or the set as a whole,
* metadata - insofar needed.

[NOTE]
====
A rule can have one of two types, which govern whether a presented DCC is **acceptable** as follows:

[horizontal]
Acceptance:: All rules must evaluate to `true`.
Invalidation:: No rule must evaluate to `true` &hArr; all rules must evaluate to `false`.

Tests of an individual rule should adapt their reporting on the rule's type.
Rule set-level tests should either target all (applicable) Acceptance (x-)or Invalidation rules.
