# TODOs

## For _Minimum Lovable Product_

* &#10003; Refresh after loading contents.
* &#10003; Use MobX instead of those dreadful React hooks.
* &#10003; Import (any number of) rules.
  * Provide a drop zone for uploading/importing rules.
* &#10003; Visualize the rule set, without editing capabilities - just leading up to tests.
* &#10003; Import (any number of) test for individual rules.
* &#10003; Run tests reactively.
  * Improve internal data modeling.
* Provide some example rules (and associated tests) that can be imported in the IDE through a button.
* Export the whole rule set.


## Later

* Make a separate repair facility for malformed JSON in storage.
* Specific editor for a test case consisting of a DCC + externals.
* Combine with analysis tooling to check whether a rule set does what it's supposed to do without specifying tests.
